# MQ2 Gas Sensor Smoke Detector with Arduino Uno R3


The MQ2 Gas Sensor Smoke Detector project combines the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller with the MQ2 gas sensor to create an efficient and reliable smoke detection system. This project serves as an early warning system, detecting smoke and hazardous gases in the environment to prevent fire incidents.

## Features

- Integration of Arduino Uno R3 and MQ2 gas sensor for accurate detection
- Early warning system with alarm triggers for timely alerts
- Customizable for advanced features such as email or SMS notifications
- Cost-effective solution for enhanced fire safety

## Repository Contents

- `circuit_diagram.png`: Circuit diagram for easy replication
- `arduino_code.ino`: Arduino code for programming the Uno R3
- `documentation.pdf`: Comprehensive documentation for project setup and customization

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mq2-smoke-detector.git`
2. Connect the MQ2 gas sensor to the Arduino Uno R3 following the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the `arduino_code.ino` file to the Arduino Uno R3 using the Arduino IDE or compatible software.
4. Customize the code to add advanced features or modify the alarm thresholds as per your requirements.
5. Power on the system and test the smoke detection functionality.
